## Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions

2,4,6,8,10...

- a is first term
- d is pattern
- FT is first term
- LT is last term

a = 2
d = 2

a + d
a + 2d
a + (n - 1)d

avg = sum / n
sum = avg * n
= ((FT + LT) / 2) * n
= n / 2 * (a + a + (n - 1)d)
= n / 2 * (2a + (n - 1)d)

r = 2
a * r
a * r^2
a * r^n - 1

= a * (1 - r^n) / 1 - r

## Prime Numbers

- Every prime number can be represented in form 6n+1 or 6n-1 except 2 and 3, where n is natural number
