### DSA

## Order of Growth

Direct Way

1. Ignore lower terms
2. Ignore leading constants

Commonly seen terms in order of efficentcy:

C < loglog n < log n < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 < n^4 < 2^n < n^n

## Big O Notation

Covers the upper bound and lower bounds: worst case, average case, best case

Direct Way of finding c:
- Take the constant on the highest leading term and add 1

## Omega Notation

Covers the lowerbound
